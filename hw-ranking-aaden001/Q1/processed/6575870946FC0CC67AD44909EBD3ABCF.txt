There's been a coronavirus outbreak at USC.
Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the LA County Director of Public Health, says "Public Health and the University of Southern California currently are investigating a cluster of four cases of COVID-19 at USC. Of the cases being investigated, two patients are confirmed to have the UK variant and two are suspected as variant cases and still awaiting laboratory confirmation."
All patients are doing well and are in isolation.
Dr. Ferrer says there now are a total of 18 confirmed cases of the UK variant in LA County. Almost half of the coronavirus infections since December have been what's being called the California Variant," which also is more infectious.
A review of deaths during the surge in December and January has discovered more than 800 additional coronavirus fatalities.
