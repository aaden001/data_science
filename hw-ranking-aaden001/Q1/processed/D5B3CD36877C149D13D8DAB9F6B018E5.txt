Minnesota's fourth large-scale, permanent community vaccination site will launch this week at Mall of America.
According to Gov. Tim Walz's office, MOA will serve around 9,190 pre-kindergarten through grade 12 educators, school staff and child care workers in its first week.
"We're continuing to build a reliable network of options for Minnesotans to access the vaccine," Walz said. "In addition to helping all Minnesotans find out when, where, and how to get their vaccine through the Vaccine Connector, the site at the Mall of America expands the network to give more Minnesotans access to shots in their communities."
NEW: We’re launching a community vaccination site at the Mall of America.
In the first week, 8,000+ educators and child care workers will be able to get vaccinated. We’ll also have more than 10,000 doses for age 65+ this week at other sites.
