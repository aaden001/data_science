Journalists in the Italian City of Treviso are reporting this morning, that dozens of teachers called in sick yesterday. The teachers had all been given a coronavirus vaccine over the weekend.
The Tribuna di Treviso broke the story last night. 15 teachers at Duca degli Abruzzi high school phoned in sick complaining of fever, malaise, and pain in the bones. A nearby primary school, San Domenico Savio, also reported that teachers had fallen ill after they were vaccinated. All of the teachers received the AstraZeneca jab.
It’s not known if the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab will be suspended pending an investigation. As The Richie Allen Show has reported, 37 staff at a hospital in Germany fell ill after receiving their AstraZeneca shots and dozens of ambulance drivers in Dortmund were incapacitated after they had the jab.
There has been no mention of any of these incidents in the UK media. I cannot and will not in good conscience, advise anyone as to what medicines they should and shouldn’t take. I have no right. You’re on your own there. But I will be frank when discussing my own intentions.
There is mounting evidence, that these vaccines (which are not really vaccines) are causing harm and death. Coronavirus, whatever it is, has a 99.7 per cent survival rate, the average age of those who succumb to it is in the mid-80’s and even then it’s people with serious underlying health conditions. Therefore, I have no fear of it.
Why anyone would want to take an experimental medicine, the trials for which are still ongoing and won’t end for another two years, is beyond me. It’s akin to playing Russian Roulette. It’s madness. But the squeeze is on. Our governments are desperate that we all receive it. And now they’ve set their sights on children, for whom the virus is mostly harmless.
