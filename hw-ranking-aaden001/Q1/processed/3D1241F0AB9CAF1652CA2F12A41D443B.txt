A Fijian rugby league team took to their quarantine hotel balconies to thank staff with a stirring song.
Members of the Fijian rugby league team, the Kaiviti Silktails, have sung a heartfelt hymn to thank the staff of a Sydney hotel where they have spent two weeks in quarantine.
From their individual room balconies at the Sofitel Wentworth Hotel in central Sydney, the Fijian players sung and clapped in unison, while other guests filmed from their own balconies.
The Silktails are in Sydney to prepare for their first full season in the Ron Massey Cup, a semi-professional development competition in NSW.
