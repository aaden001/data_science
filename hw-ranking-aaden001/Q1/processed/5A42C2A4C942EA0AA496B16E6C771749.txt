(ABC 6 News) - CG Public Health and MercyOne North Iowa have developed a plan for an additional point of distribution for COVID-19 vaccines in Cerro Gordo County.
Through this plan, MercyOne North Iowa is utilizing a COVID-19 vaccine interest list where you can sign up and await notification for your opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine through MercyOne North Iowa. The interest list is open to public and is not limited to patients of MercyOne North Iowa.
As vaccine supply increases, CG Public Health will allocate doses to MercyOne North Iowa to vaccinate those on the waiting list; MercyOne will contact eligible patients by phone and offer an appointment. If you do not respond on the first attempt to reach you, the appointment time will be given to the next person on the list.  MercyOne North Iowa will attempt to contact you the next time vaccine is available.
If you would like to sign-up to be placed on the vaccine interest list, click here .
Being on the MercyOne list does not prevent you from receiving the vaccine elsewhere. CG Public Healths encourages to continue pursuing other options to receive the vaccine including through CG Public Health’s sign-up.
Until vaccine is widely available, it is critical we all continue to practice the mitigation measures to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus:
Wear a mask or face covering.
Practice social distancing with those outside your household.
Clean your hands frequently with soap and water.
Stay home if you feel sick.
