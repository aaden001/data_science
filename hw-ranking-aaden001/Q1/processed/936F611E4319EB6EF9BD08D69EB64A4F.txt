Researchers from  Tel Aviv University, Bar Ilan University, and Azrieli College have demonstrated  that ozone can effectively be used to disinfect surfaces which have been  contaminated with the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2.
Ozone is a strong  oxidant and disinfectant, often employed in water and wastewater treatment  schemes. Within the study framework, the research team decided to adapt the  mechanisms whereby ozone is used to break down organic pollutants from  contaminated waters and demonstrated the efficacy of ozone in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2.
Ozone gas is  generated by electrical discharge (the breakdown of chemical compounds into  their elements using electric current), in the course of which oxygen molecules  are reconstructed in the form of ozone molecules. In the course of their study,  the researchers demonstrated that gaseous Ozone disinfected surfaces, even in  hard-to-reach locations. A high level of disinfection was achieved within  minutes, even on surfaces not typically disinfected with manually-applied  liquid disinfectants.
The method  involves inexpensive and readily available technologies, which could be  utilized to disinfect hospitals, schools, offices, hotels, and even aircraft  and entertainment halls.
The researchers  say that since the gas can be produced relatively cheaply and easily, it should  be possible to introduce ozone disinfecting systems on an industrial scale to  combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
