Hot News: A New Milestone, 1.11 Million Pageviews
My Dear Friends:
Launched on the first day of 2013, NeverEnding Story crossed the 1.11 million view mark last night.
I am grateful to everyone who has been a part of this poetry journey. And look forward to reading your haiku and tanka (see anthology submission guidelines for haiku and tanka )
In a time of crisis, poetry can help focus our fears and transform "noise into music."

across the river of no return
