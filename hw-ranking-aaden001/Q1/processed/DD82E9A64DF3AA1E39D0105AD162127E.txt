NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center sites in New Jersey have not yet received COVID-19 vaccines from the Department of Health .
As CBS2’s Meg Baker reported Wednesday, advocates and patients are now calling on the state for help.
“I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in September of 2019,” Highland Park resident Darcie Cimarusti said.

Cimarusti is a patient with Memorial Sloan Kettering, both in New York City and New Jersey. But as explained on the hospital’s website, the New York locations are offering vaccinations to New York residents only, and the New Jersey sites have not been granted vaccines from the state health department.
“We should be trying to limit the exposure for the patients who are the most vulnerable,” Cimarusti said.
