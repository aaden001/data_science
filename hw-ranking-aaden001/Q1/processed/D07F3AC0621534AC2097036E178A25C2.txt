TWO people have been reported for summons after breaching coronavirus rules on Saturday night (February 20).
The force stopped a vehicle on the A3057, near Heron Lane in Timsbury, at around 11pm and discovered a woman and a man had visited another household.
The 24-year-old woman and 26-year-old man have now been reported for summons in relation to a fixed penalty notice after breaking the current Health Protection Regulations.
Under the current lockdown rules, you cannot leave your home to meet socially with anyone you do not live with or are not in a support bubble with.
