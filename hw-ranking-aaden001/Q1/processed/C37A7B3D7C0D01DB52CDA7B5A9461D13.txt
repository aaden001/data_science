Small business revenues have fallen for the first time since May.
Year-on-year revenues declined by 6 per cent in the month of January while jobs increased by almost 2 per cent, according to data from Xero Small Business Insights.
The drop in small firm earnings follows seven months of consecutive revenue growth in the June to December period.
Declines were experienced by businesses across all regions of the country, with Queenstown firms the hardest hit, experiencing a more than 23 per cent decline in revenue.

Big drops were also felt in Otago - revenues down 14.7 per cent, Waikato down 7.8 per cent, Bay of Plenty down 5.6 per cent and Hawke's Bay down 4.6 per cent. Auckland revenues were down 4 per cent, the least of all regions.
Xero managing director Craig Hudson said the downturn in revenue was a sign "Kiwis needed to continue to support local businesses".
"We often see small business revenue fall in January due to the holiday period, with businesses closing for the Christmas and summer break. It's always a tough month and Covid-19 has made it even harder this year," said Hudson.
