The head of the United Kingdom's National Health Service pushed back against actress Gwyneth Paltrow's claims on how to recover from the coronavirus.
"In the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she's recommending are really not the solutions we'd recommend in the NHS," Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said, BBC reported .
Paltrow wrote on her blog that she was suffering long-term effects from the coronavirus and that a "functional medicine practitioner" told her to participate in an "intuitive fasting" program in order to feel better.
The program includes not eating until 11 every day, infrared saunas, no sugar, no alcohol, and a plant-based and ketogenic-based diet.
"Everything I'm doing feels good, like a gift to my body. I have energy, I'm working out in the mornings, and I'm doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing," Paltrow wrote.
Powis said those who have a big social media platform have a "responsibility" to not spread misinformation to their followers and that Paltrow's solutions for her health are "really not the solutions we'd recommend."
The United Kingdom has seen over four million confirmed cases and over 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus
The UK is also fighting a new variant that developed in their region that has shown to be more deadly and more contagious than previous coronavirus variants.
