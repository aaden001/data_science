As of Tuesday, 24 workers at Cargill's meat processing facility on Watson Parkway have tested positive for COVID-19.
These numbers were confirmed by Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health on Wednesday.
All positive cases from the facility are related to the outbreak declared on Jan. 8 and the facility is said to continue its safety protocols such as personal protective equipment, physical barriers, increased sanitation, social distancing, temperature testing, travel restrictions, and visitor restrictions.
Last week, the facility on Watson Parkway’s case count was 20, with four active cases and 18 employees isolating. It is unclear how many cases are currently active.
Guelph has six new cases and 58 active cases as of Wednesday morning.
The outbreak in Cargill’s meat processing facility on Dunlop Drive was declared over by Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health over three weeks ago after all 188 cases were cleared by Public Health.
Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
