ROCHESTER, N.Y. (WHEC) — The New York State Department of Health released new nursing home visitation guidelines Monday.
New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker announced the updated rules rely on the positivity rate in each county.
If a county has less than a 5% COVID-19 infection rate, no testing is required, but it is encouraged. If the county's infection rate is between 5% and 10%, the state requires visitors to get a rapid test 72 hours in advance. If a county has more than a 10% infection rate, visitors are not allowed except for compassionate care situations.
If a guest has had both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination within 90 days, a test is not required but encouraged, Zucker said.

The new guidelines go into effect Friday, Feb. 26. A nursing home still has to be COVID-19-free for 14-days for these guidelines to apply.
The state will provide nursing homes with COVID-19 tests to offer to visitors who are required to be tested at no charge.
