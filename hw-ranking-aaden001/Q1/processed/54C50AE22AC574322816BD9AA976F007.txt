(ABC 6 News) - The Mason City Chamber of Commerce highlighted its response to the pandemic during the State of North Iowa.
Last year, state and local leaders celebrated the mounting momentum in Mason City during the inaugural event. Then, the pandemic came crashing down hard on local businesses and the chamber knew it was its time to shine.
“If the chamber of commerce didn’t stand up at a time when local commerce and industry was really threatened, then they don’t need us,” said President and CEO of the Mason City Chamber of Commerce Robin Anderson.
Vision North Iowa partners gave an update on the local economy, sharing the successes of their strategic planning.
“Early on, these partners vowed to keep north Iowa open for business and to keep our essential workers safe,” Anderson said. “People need to know that something is still happening with this. It’s not just a plan that’s sitting on a shelf.”
Thanks to the working relationships made prior to the pandemic, local leaders were able to quickly organize a plan to benefit business owners.
“The chamber – out there for all the businesses has just been a great support,” said Broker Jane Fischer. “Just the day to day running of - turning the lights on and keeping the business going, keeping everybody staffed and employed.”
“This was the time when we really needed to show our value to them by connecting them to resources that would keep them in business. That’s what we do,” Anderson said.
