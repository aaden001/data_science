CLEARVIEW YOUTH CENTRE
The Clearview Youth Centre, with the assistance of the Clearview Public Library, will be distributing 150 wellness kits containing basic hygiene products like shampoo, soap, deodorant, socks, and local support resources for anyone who needs one.
Developed to support families and individuals financially affected by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the Wellness Kit Program is made possible through the joint efforts of the Government of Canada’s Emergency Community Support Fund, Community Foundations of Canada, and the Township of Clearview. The objective is to help ease the financial burden facing many in our community as the pandemic continues.
“COVID-19 has affected so many families and individuals,” said Courtney Rogers, youth centre coordinator. “We wanted to create these kits to provide some necessities so people can put their resources where it matters."
“The Clearview Public Library is pleased to be a curbside pick up location for the Wellness Kits.” added Jennifer La Chapelle, Clearview Public Library CEO. “No appointment is necessary, visit your local branch during operating hours for a kit.”
The kits have been put together to meet the needs of residents of all ages and can be requested from six locations throughout Clearview, the Clearview Youth Centre, the Clearview Food Bank and via curbside pick up from all three branches of the Clearview Public Library.
