Worried that a drop in testing could delay the easing of coronavirus business restrictions, Riverside County officials on Wednesday, Feb. 24 urged the public to get tested for COVID-19.
The county’s test rate, which rose to 800 test per 100,000 residents last year, now stands at 361.4 per 100,000, a county news release read. That’s below the state median testing rate of 386.4 per 100,000, meaning the county’s daily rate of new cases is adjusted upward.
As of Tuesday, Feb. 23, the county’s adjusted case per 100,000 residents was 16.6, according to the state Department of Public Health . It needs to be between 4 and 7 per 100,000 for the county to move from the purple tier, or most restrictive tier of COVID-19 business restrictions, to the red tier, which will allow certain businesses to operate more freely and handle more customers indoors.
