LETTER WRITTEN FOR A PARENT TO SEND TO HER DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL REGARDING CORONAVIRUS PROTOCOLS
Dear [names],
Re: coronavirus protocols
I am writing to you regarding my daughter, [name], who is due to return to year [number] in September. [Name] has been very happy at [school name] and is looking forward to returning next month. Thanks to you and the other staff for everything you've done to make her journey there so far a happy one.
However, both she and I have some concerns that we would like to address in writing before term commences. In the first instance and as you know, I do not consent to vaccines for [name], and now that she is approaching an age where she may be considered Gillick competent, it is important to underline she does not consent to them, either. She understands the risks and benefits of vaccinations, and chooses not to receive them. Affixed to this letter is a short written statement from [name] confirming this. I know that there can sometimes be confusion on vaccination days and children who have been opted out of vaccination nevertheless receive them, and that sometimes vaccination days happen without warning, so I just felt for extra peace of mind for me and [name], we would make clear our position formally and in writing before term begins.
Leading on from this are the other protocols the school may be putting in place as a response to the coronavirus situation. I do not feel that schools are the place for medical processes to take place, and I only allow trusted healthcare professionals to conduct medical procedures on my daughter. Therefore, I do not consent to my daughter receiving any coronavirus testing at school. If she develops symptoms of illness, I will keep her at home as I would with any other illness, and arrange any necessary testing or treatment myself.
I also do not consent to my daughter using hand sanitiser. Hand sanitisers contain powerful chemicals that permeate the skin and enter the bloodstream, as well as being implicated in causing dermatitis and destroying vital beneficial bacteria on the skin - essential for maintaining a strong immune system. I do not consent to this product being used on my daughter for any reason, and only consent to her washing her hands with conventional soap and water.
If the school intends to temperature-check the children, I do not consent to my daughter being tested at the forehead with an infrared thermometer gun. I am not comfortable with the psychological connotations of my daughter repeatedly having a gun pointed at her head, and there may also be short and long-term safety issues with aiming this instrument directly at a developing brain. Therefore, I only consent to my daughter being temperature checked at the wrist.
My daughter and I also do not give our consent to participating in the NHS track and trace scheme, and do not want our contact details passed over to the NHS or any other agency for the purposes of tracking and tracing.  Any agency having or using our data without our consent is in breach of the GDPR and therefore illegal.
I do not know what the school's policy will be on mask-wearing, but I wish to make clear the legal position on masks, which is that those suffering hidden disabilities are exempt, and under the Equalities Act 2010 and Disabilities Discrimination Act, it is illegal to ask someone if they have a hidden disability or what it is. Therefore, were the school to mandate masks, it would be illegal for them to ask any pupil why they were not wearing one. It would also be incumbent on the school to instruct all pupils and staff on the law regarding masks and exemptions, to ensure nobody without a mask is discriminated against, which is illegal under the Equalities Act and could result in the school being sued.
Finally, I do not consent to any detainment of my daughter on school premises or elsewhere for any reason. I expect her to return home at the usual time every day unless I have given my express permission otherwise.
Please reply to this letter at your earliest possible convenience acknowledging my concerns and agreeing that my daughter will not be subject to any measures I have not expressly offered my consent for.
Thank you for your time.
Yours sincerely,
[name]
STATEMENT FROM [NAME]
I, [name], do not consent to receiving any vaccinations. I understand the risks and benefits of vaccinations and I do not consent to receiving any. If I am vaccinated without a parent present, it will have been under duress, and therefore illegal.
