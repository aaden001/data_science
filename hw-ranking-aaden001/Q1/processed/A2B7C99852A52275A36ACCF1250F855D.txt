Abstract
Since the emergence of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 in China, and with the urge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been a huge effort of many research teams and governmental institutions worldwide to mitigate the current scenario. Reaching more than 1,377,000 deaths in the world and still with a growing number of infections, SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical issue for global health and economic systems, with an urgency for available therapeutic options. In this scenario, as drug repurposing and discovery remains a challenge, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches, including machine learning (ML) techniques, can be useful tools to the design and discovery of novel potential antiviral inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we describe and review the current knowledge on this virus and the pandemic, the latest strategies and computational approaches applied to search for treatment options, as well as the challenges to overcome COVID-19.
