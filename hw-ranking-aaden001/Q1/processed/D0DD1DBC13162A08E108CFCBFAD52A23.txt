Even in its most optimistic scenario, with travel restrictions gradually lifted as vaccines are rolled out in developed countries ahead of the peak summer season, it would only be enough to fuel "tepid" demand at 38% of 2019 levels.
If restrictions remain tight, it could be even lower.

Airport backs 'safe' flightpath to holiday restart
The summer season could prove critical for airlines already on their knees after last year's struggles.
IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac said: "2021 is shaping up to be a much tougher year than previously expected.
"More emergency relief from governments will be needed.
"A functioning airline industry can eventually energise the economic recovery from COVID-19.
"But that won't happen if there are massive failures before the crisis ends.
"If governments are unable to open their borders, we will need them to open their wallets with financial relief to keep airlines viable."
Mr de Juniac said the UK had "set a good example" by laying out its roadmap for reopening this week, giving airlines a framework to restart even if they need to adjust it later - and prompting a spike in holiday bookings .
IATA said its travel pass, which will formally launch at the end of March, would help to facilitate travel by putting coronavirus test results and vaccine certificates in one digital format, speeding up check-in.
It said the pass would "enable travellers to securely control their health data and share it with relevant authorities".
Air New Zealand, Etihad, Emirates and Singapore Airlines are among the carriers that have carried out or committed to trials with the pass, IATA said.
The organisation said it was vital that countries start issuing digital vaccine credentials in order for international travel to take off.
