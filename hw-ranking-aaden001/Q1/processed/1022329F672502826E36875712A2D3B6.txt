The success of the vaccine programme is among the four key tests which will be examined each step of the way.

The current aim regarding vaccination is to have reached all top nine priority groups by the middle of April, which culminates in having offered a jab to everyone aged over 50.
Professor Jonathan Van-Tam told Sky News that the pace of the programme would pick up again soon, saying it was down to "global supply restraints" and vaccine manufacturers working towards a "steady routine".
"There are always going to be supply fluctuations. These are new vaccines, by and large the manufacturers have not made them or anything like them before," he said.
All adults in the UK should have been offered a jab by the end of July, just over a month after the government hopes to have relaxed England's final slate of lockdown restrictions on 21 June.

Scotland's route out of lockdown will come in stages, with the country's stay-at-home order set to end on 5 April, followed weeks later by a return to a system of levels, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.
Northern Ireland has also recently extended lockdown restrictions , although some measures will be eased from 8 March, with First Minister Arlene Foster promising a full review on 18 March.
And Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford last week extended lockdown in Wales for at least another three weeks and has said he will use the time to look at options for reopening shops and hairdressers.
