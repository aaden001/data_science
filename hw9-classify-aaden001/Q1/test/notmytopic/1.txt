Did you know that it’s just as easy for malware to end up on your mobile phone or tablet as it is on your computer? As a Yahoo member, you are important to us, so we want to make sure you know how to tell if a malicious app is on your phone.

 
Signs of bad apps on your phone:
 
1.	 	
Slow Internet Connections
Malicious apps use a lot of internet bandwidth to operate. If your connection speeds suddenly crash to nothing, that can be a clear sign.

 
2.	 	
Using Too Much Data
Even if you have an unlimited data plan, always keep an eye on your data usage for sudden spikes.

 
3.	 	
Your Battery Life Is Bad
Malicious apps require a lot of battery life. If you go from a full charge that lasts all day to suddenly having to charge your phone almost all day, then you may have a problem.

 
Don't try blocking or tackling this malware on your own. Get Norton Security Online. It scans and removes malicious apps and helps prevent new ones from installing on your device. You can try it FREE* for 30 days.
