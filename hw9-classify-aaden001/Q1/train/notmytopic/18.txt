Dear Sir/Madam,

Life is never planned. It beats us at our game all the time. But masters of time have learnt how to manage life and time. The first lesson is this:
store meaningful contacts that you may need.

We never knew how important that lesson was until we lost a 5million naira contract. The CEO of the board was waiting for us to show up at the bidding meeting, while we were in Porthacourt trying to book the next available flight. But we could find none our money could take.

This pain and loss led us to establish DoQuick Travel Agency, an agency specifically tailored for emergencies and affordable flights - economy, business or
first class. With our strong contact at every airway that flies into and from Nigeria, we give you the best at all times.

Store this email, book now and call us when next you or your team members or staff think of flying.
